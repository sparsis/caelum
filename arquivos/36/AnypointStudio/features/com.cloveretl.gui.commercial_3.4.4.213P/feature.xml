6.1 Software Warranty: JAVLIN warrants that, for a period of sixty (60) days, from the initial delivery of the Software Program to LICENSEE, the Software Program, if used by LICENSEE in accordance with the Documentation, shall operate in material conformity with the Documentation for such Software Program. Pursuant to the warranty and limited liability limitations set forth in this agreement, JAVLIN warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software Program, or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will not infringe any copyright rights of any third party, and JAVLIN has all rights necessary for the grant of the rights. In the case of a non-conformity claim, LICENSEE shall provide JAVLIN a reproducible test case demonstrating the breach of warranty.
6.2 JAVLIN does not warrant that the Software Program will meet all of LICENSEE requirements or that the use of the Software Program will be uninterrupted or error free. JAVLIN's entire liability and LICENSEE exclusive remedy, under this limited software warranty shall be for JAVLIN: (i) to attempt to correct through reasonable efforts, any reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the sixty (60) day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software Program with Software Program which conforms to the foregoing warranty.
6.3 In the event JAVLIN is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in 6.2(i) and 6.2(ii) above, LICENSEE may return the Software Program and JAVLIN shall refund a portion of the license and maintenance fees paid by LICENSEE to JAVLIN for the Software Program. The refund of maintenance fees shall be limited to the amount representing the period during which the Software Program showed nonconformity. The above remedies are available only if JAVLIN is promptly notified in writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the nonconformity by LICENSEE and JAVLIN's examination of the Software Program discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software Program has not been (i) altered or modified other than by JAVLIN; (ii) subjected to negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions; or (iii) used, adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the Documentation.
6.4 Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM, AND JAVLIN EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
6.5 This Software Program is developed for general use in a variety of information and data management applications. It is not developed or intended for use in any inherently dangerous applications, including applications that may create a risk of personal injury. If you use this Software Program in dangerous applications, then you shall be responsible to take all appropriate fail-safe, backup, redundancy, and other measures to ensure its safe use. JAVLIN and its affiliates disclaim any liability for any damages caused by use of this Software Program in dangerous or high risk applications.

Section 7 - Software Indemnification
JAVLIN agrees to indemnify, defend and hold LICENSEE harmless, up to the amount of license fees paid by licensee, from any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs, liabilities, reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) and damages arising from any claim that the Software Program infringes any copyright right of a third party, and finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided, however:
(1) LICENSEE shall promptly deliver to JAVLIN notice in writing of any copyright infringement claim made by a third party, but in no event not more than ten (10) business days after the LICENSEE becomes aware of such claim; and, if known, specify in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of the liability arising therefrom. LICENSEE shall, at JAVLIN's expense, provide to JAVLIN as promptly as practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably requested by JAVLIN to support and verify the claim asserted, provided that, in so doing, JAVLIN may restrict or condition any disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance in any foreseeable litigation.
(2) JAVLIN may assume and retain sole control of the investigation, the defense or the settlement of any third party infringement claim made against LICENSEE or JAVLIN with respect to the Software Program, including the employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense. LICENSEE shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by JAVLIN in any such action and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by LICENSEE shall be at LICENSEE's expense. JAVLIN shall have the right to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by LICENSEE, to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable discretion. JAVLIN shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Whether or not JAVLIN chooses to so investigate or defend such claim, LICENSEE shall cooperate with JAVLIN in the defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by JAVLIN in connection therewith.
(3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely to arise, LICENSEE agrees to allow JAVLIN, at JAVLIN's option, to either: (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it becomes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance; or (iii) terminate the license for the infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by LICENSEE, refund license fees outlined in Warranty paragraph 6.2,, but in no event more than the total license fees paid.
(4) JAVLIN shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of any intellectual property infringement resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or data not supplied by JAVLIN if such infringement would have been avoided by use of the Software Program alone.

Section 8 - Termination and Disposition of Software
Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if affected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default. Should an insolvency proceeding be filed by or against either party; the other party may terminate this agreement forthwith by giving a written notice to the first party. Upon termination of this agreement, LICENSEE will either return to JAVLIN or destroy all copies of the Software Program, License Key and documentation then in LICENSEE's possession.

Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that: (i) you are not acting on behalf of any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is controlled by the government of any country to which the United States, the European Union or other applicable government body has prohibited export transactions (e.g. Iran, North Korea, Sudan.); (ii) you are not acting on behalf of, any person or entity listed on a relevant list of persons to whom export is prohibited (e.g. the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, the U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List or Entity List); and (iii) you will not use the Software Program for any purpose prohibited by applicable law.

Section 10 - Entire Agreement
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged herein. No amendment or modification of this agreement or any provision or attachment of this agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.

Section 12 - Assignment and Benefit
Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may assign this agreement; provided, however, JAVLIN or LICENSEE may assign this agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respective corporation or a corporation in which the shareholders of the respective corporation own a majority interest of the voting control provided that the assigning party remains obligated hereunder; further provided, however, JAVLIN or LICENSEE may assign this agreement to another corporation which acquires or has acquired substantially all of the stock or assets of the assignor. This agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of LICENSEE and JAVLIN and each party's successors, subject to the other provisions of this Section. This license is granted to you only and as such does not permit you to sell, lend, assign, lease or transfer in any other way any copy of the Software Program.
