Pursuant to the warranty and limited liability limitations set forth in this agreement, JAVLIN warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software Program, or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will not infringe any copyright rights of any third party, and JAVLIN has all rights necessary for the grant of the rights.

<p><strong>6.2</strong> JAVLIN does not warrant that the Software Program will meet all of LICENSEE requirements or that the use of the Software Program will be uninterrupted or error free.

<p><strong>6.3</strong> In the event JAVLIN is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in 6.2(i) and 6.2(ii) above, LICENSEE may return the Software Program and JAVLIN shall refund a portion of the  license and maintenance fees paid by LICENSEE to JAVLIN for the Software Program.

The above remedies are available only if JAVLIN is promptly notified in writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the nonconformity by LICENSEE and JAVLIN's examination of the Software Program discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software Program has not been (i) altered or modified other than by JAVLIN; (ii) subjected to negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions; or (iii) used, adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the Documentation.</p>   
<p><strong>6.4</strong>  Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM, AND JAVLIN EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>  
<p><strong>6.5</strong> This Software Program is developed for general use in a variety of information and data management applications.

JAVLIN and its affiliates disclaim any liability for any damages caused by use of this Software Program in dangerous or high risk applications.</p> 
 
<h2>Section 7 – Software Indemnification</h2>
<p>JAVLIN agrees to indemnify, defend and hold LICENSEE harmless, up to the amount of license fees paid by licensee, from any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs, liabilities, reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) and damages arising from any claim that the Software Program infringes any copyright right of a third party, and finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided, however:</p> 
<p class="indent">(1) LICENSEE shall promptly deliver to JAVLIN notice in writing of any copyright infringement claim made by a third party, but in no event not more than ten (10) business days after the LICENSEE becomes aware of such claim; and, if known, specify in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of the liability arising therefrom. LICENSEE shall, at JAVLIN's expense, provide to JAVLIN as promptly as practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably requested by JAVLIN to support and verify the claim asserted, provided that, in so doing, JAVLIN may restrict or condition any disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance in any foreseeable litigation.</p> 
<p class="indent">(2) JAVLIN may assume and retain sole control of the investigation, the defense or the settlement of any third party infringement claim made against LICENSEE or JAVLIN with respect to the Software Program, including the employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense. LICENSEE shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by JAVLIN in any such action and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by LICENSEE shall be at LICENSEE’s expense.  JAVLIN shall have the right to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by LICENSEE, to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable discretion. JAVLIN shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not JAVLIN chooses to so investigate or defend such claim, LICENSEE shall cooperate with JAVLIN in the defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by JAVLIN in connection therewith.</p> 
<p class="indent">(3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely to arise, LICENSEE agrees to allow JAVLIN, at JAVLIN's option, to either: (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it becomes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance; or (iii) terminate the license for the infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by LICENSEE, refund license fees outlined in Warranty paragraph 6.2,, but in no event more than the total license fees paid. </p>
<p class="indent">(4) JAVLIN shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of any intellectual property infringement resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or data not supplied by JAVLIN if such infringement would have been avoided by use of the Software Program alone.</p>  
 
<h2>Section 8 – Termination and Disposition of Software</h2> 
<p>Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if affected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Should an insolvency proceeding be filed by or against either party; the other party may terminate this agreement forthwith by giving a written notice to the first party.  Upon termination of this agreement, LICENSEE will either return to JAVLIN or destroy all copies of the Software Program, License Key and documentation then in LICENSEE’s possession. LICENSEE shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of such termination furnish JAVLIN with a certification of compliance.</p>

<h2>Section 10 - Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>This agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements, representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged herein. No amendment or modification of this agreement or any provision or attachment of this agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.</p> 
 
<h2>Section 11 - Governing Law</h2>
<p>The validity, construction and performance of this agreement shall be governed by the substantive laws of Czech Republic (excluding conflicts of law principles). LICENSEE and JAVLIN agree that any dispute arising out of this agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Czech Republic. If any legal action is undertaken to enforce the terms of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.</p>
